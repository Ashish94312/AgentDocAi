   - Check environment variables are set correctly
   - Ensure migrations are run

3. **Static Files Not Loading**
   - Verify WhiteNoise is configured
   - Check STATIC_ROOT setting
   - Ensure collectstatic runs during build

4. **Application Not Starting**
   - Check CMD in Dockerfile
   - Verify PORT environment variable
   - Check application logs

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check application status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs

# Connect to database
railway connect postgres

# Run shell commands
railway run python manage.py shell
```
